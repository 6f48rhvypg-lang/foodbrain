# FoodBrain Handoff

Current date: 2026-06-02

## Current State

- Repository: `https://github.com/RSM-CEI/foodbrain`
- Branch: `main`
- Latest local implementation and documentation changes are intended to be committed and pushed before continuing on another PC.
- The Python sidecar service can read Grocy stock, score expiry urgency, match local recipes against stock, print CLI output, and optionally publish a Home Assistant webhook summary.
- Grocy `/api/stock` parsing now has unit tests, an automatic diagnostics command, and an optional real-data contract test.
- Local household data exports should be saved under `.foodbrain-local/`, which is ignored by git.
- Live Grocy credentials can be stored in a local ignored `.env` file copied from `.env.example`.
- LIVE-VERIFIED (2026-06-02): Confirmed against a real self-hosted Grocy instance
  (Proxmox LXC at `http://192.168.178.150`). `scripts/fetch_grocy_stock.py` pulled
  the live `/api/stock`, diagnostics passed with no errors/warnings, the contract
  test passed, and `foodbrain` produced a real recommendation. Roadmap Phase 3
  "Verify Grocy response parsing against real household data" is now complete.
- The real Grocy base URL and API key live only in the local ignored `.env`; they
  are not committed. Re-create `.env` from `.env.example` on each machine.

## Changed In This Session

- Started Phase 4 recipe matching with local recipe fixtures (the recommended next step from the previous handoff).
- Added `foodbrain_assistant.recipes`: loads recipes from local JSON files and parses ingredient lines into quantity, unit, and normalized name.
- Added `foodbrain_assistant.models.Recipe`, `RecipeIngredient`, and `RecipeMatch`; `RunResult` now carries `recipe_matches`.
- Added `foodbrain_assistant.matching`: deterministic recipe-to-stock matching ranked by `coverage + 0.5 * expiry_usefulness`.
- Added `foodbrain --recipes-json PATH`, which works with `--sample`, `--grocy-stock-json`, and live Grocy runs; recipe matches are shown in text and JSON output and included in the Home Assistant webhook payload.
- Added `FOODBRAIN_TOP_RECIPE_LIMIT` (default 5) to `config.Settings`, `.env.example`, and README.
- Added `examples/recipes.sample.json` and tests `tests/test_recipes.py` and `tests/test_matching.py`.
- Test suite is now 30 tests (1 skipped: the optional real-data contract test).

### Phase 3 (prior session)

- Added `parse_stock_response` coverage for common Grocy stock response shapes.
- Added `diagnose_stock_response` to summarize real Grocy payload compatibility.
- Added `foodbrain --grocy-stock-json` for running recommendations against an exported Grocy stock JSON file.
- Added `foodbrain --diagnose-grocy-stock-json` for validating an exported stock JSON file before using it.
- Added `tests/test_grocy_real_stock_contract.py`, which runs only when `FOODBRAIN_GROCY_STOCK_JSON` points to a local export.
- Added `.foodbrain-local/` to `.gitignore` for private local exports.
- Added dependency-free `.env` loading so live Grocy config can be kept in a local ignored file.

## Verification Commands

Run the normal test suite:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

Expected result at handoff:

```text
Ran 30 tests
OK (skipped=1)
```

Run recipe matching against the sample stock and example recipes:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m foodbrain_assistant.cli --sample --recipes-json examples/recipes.sample.json
```

Run the sample CLI flow:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m foodbrain_assistant.cli --sample --json
```

Run diagnostics against a local Grocy export:

```bash
mkdir -p .foodbrain-local
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m foodbrain_assistant.cli --diagnose-grocy-stock-json .foodbrain-local/stock.json
```

Run the optional real-data parser contract test:

```bash
FOODBRAIN_GROCY_STOCK_JSON=.foodbrain-local/stock.json PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest tests.test_grocy_real_stock_contract
```

## Next Session Start

1. Pull the latest code on the other PC:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RSM-CEI/foodbrain.git
cd foodbrain
```

If the repo already exists there:

```bash
cd foodbrain
git pull --ff-only
```

2. Create local Grocy configuration from the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` and fill in:

```bash
FOODBRAIN_GROCY_BASE_URL=...
FOODBRAIN_GROCY_API_KEY=...
```

Do not commit `.env`.

3. Check repository state:

```bash
git status --short --branch
```

4. Run the normal tests:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

5. Run the live Grocy flow:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m foodbrain_assistant.cli
```

6. If you save a real Grocy export, run diagnostics:

```bash
mkdir -p .foodbrain-local
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m foodbrain_assistant.cli --diagnose-grocy-stock-json .foodbrain-local/stock.json
```

## Next Implementation Decision

Phase 4 recipe matching is implemented against local JSON fixtures and verified
with the sample stock. The deterministic matcher ranks recipes by pantry
coverage plus expiry usefulness, so the "what should I cook" path works end to
end without any third-party dependency.

Remaining Phase 4 work and the natural next steps:

- Add a live recipe source: Grocy `/api/objects/recipes` (plus its
  `recipes_pos` ingredient rows), Mealie, or Tandoor. The loader in
  `foodbrain_assistant.recipes` already separates parsing from the file format,
  so a `parse_grocy_recipes_response` can plug into the same `Recipe` model.
- Verify recipe matching against a real recipe export the way stock ingestion
  was verified (save under `.foodbrain-local/`, do not commit).
- Tune the matching heuristic if real recipe text over- or under-matches (the
  current rule is word-set containment with light singularization).
- Then either Phase 5 (FlavorGraph pairing) or revisit Home Assistant MQTT if a
  live dashboard is wanted.

Recommended next: wire in the Grocy recipe endpoint so matching runs on the same
real household data already used for stock, then verify it live.

To re-run the live verification on any machine that can reach the Grocy LXC:

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # then fill in the real URL + API key
PYTHONPATH=src python3 scripts/fetch_grocy_stock.py
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m foodbrain_assistant.cli --diagnose-grocy-stock-json .foodbrain-local/stock.json
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m foodbrain_assistant.cli
```

Keep inventory parsing and scoring deterministic. Do not commit `.env`, API keys, or `.foodbrain-local/` contents.
