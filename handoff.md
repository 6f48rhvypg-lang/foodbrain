# FoodBrain Handoff

Current date: 2026-06-02

## Current State

- Repository: `https://github.com/RSM-CEI/foodbrain`
- Branch: `main`
- Latest local implementation and documentation changes are intended to be committed and pushed before continuing on another PC.
- The Python sidecar service can read Grocy stock, score expiry urgency, match local recipes against stock, print CLI output, and optionally publish a Home Assistant webhook summary.
- Grocy `/api/stock` parsing now has unit tests, an automatic diagnostics command, and an optional real-data contract test.
- Local household data exports should be saved under `.foodbrain-local/`, which is ignored by git.
- Live Grocy credentials can be stored in a local ignored `.env` file copied from `.env.example`.
- LIVE-VERIFIED (2026-06-02): Confirmed against a real self-hosted Grocy instance
  (Proxmox LXC at `http://192.168.178.150`). `scripts/fetch_grocy_stock.py` pulled
  the live `/api/stock`, diagnostics passed with no errors/warnings, the contract
  test passed, and `foodbrain` produced a real recommendation. Roadmap Phase 3
  "Verify Grocy response parsing against real household data" is now complete.
- The real Grocy base URL and API key live only in the local ignored `.env`; they
  are not committed. Re-create `.env` from `.env.example` on each machine.

## Changed In This Session

### Grocy recipe source (latest)

- Added a live Grocy recipe source: `parse_grocy_recipes_response` and `diagnose_grocy_recipes` in `foodbrain_assistant.recipes` join the `recipes`, `recipes_pos`, `products`, and `quantity_units` object endpoints into the same `Recipe` model used for local files.
- Internal meal-plan recipes (`type` != `normal`) are skipped; recipes with no resolvable ingredients are dropped rather than raising, mirroring stock parsing tolerance.
- Added `GrocyClient.get_recipes()` (fetches the four object endpoints and joins them).
- Added CLI flags: `--grocy-recipes-json PATH` (match an exported bundle), `--diagnose-grocy-recipes-json PATH` (validate a bundle, non-zero exit on hard errors), and `--grocy-recipes` (fetch live from Grocy). The three recipe sources are mutually exclusive.
- Added `scripts/fetch_grocy_recipes.py` to export the recipe bundle to `.foodbrain-local/recipes.json` without committing data.
- Added `tests/test_grocy_recipes.py`. Test suite is now 37 tests (1 skipped).
- NOT yet verified against real Grocy recipe data — that is the next step (see below).

### Phase 4 local recipe matching (earlier this session)

- Started Phase 4 recipe matching with local recipe fixtures (the recommended next step from the previous handoff).
- Added `foodbrain_assistant.recipes`: loads recipes from local JSON files and parses ingredient lines into quantity, unit, and normalized name.
- Added `foodbrain_assistant.models.Recipe`, `RecipeIngredient`, and `RecipeMatch`; `RunResult` now carries `recipe_matches`.
- Added `foodbrain_assistant.matching`: deterministic recipe-to-stock matching ranked by `coverage + 0.5 * expiry_usefulness`.
- Added `foodbrain --recipes-json PATH`, which works with `--sample`, `--grocy-stock-json`, and live Grocy runs; recipe matches are shown in text and JSON output and included in the Home Assistant webhook payload.
- Added `FOODBRAIN_TOP_RECIPE_LIMIT` (default 5) to `config.Settings`, `.env.example`, and README.
- Added `examples/recipes.sample.json` and tests `tests/test_recipes.py` and `tests/test_matching.py`.

### Phase 3 (prior session)

- Added `parse_stock_response` coverage for common Grocy stock response shapes.
- Added `diagnose_stock_response` to summarize real Grocy payload compatibility.
- Added `foodbrain --grocy-stock-json` for running recommendations against an exported Grocy stock JSON file.
- Added `foodbrain --diagnose-grocy-stock-json` for validating an exported stock JSON file before using it.
- Added `tests/test_grocy_real_stock_contract.py`, which runs only when `FOODBRAIN_GROCY_STOCK_JSON` points to a local export.
- Added `.foodbrain-local/` to `.gitignore` for private local exports.
- Added dependency-free `.env` loading so live Grocy config can be kept in a local ignored file.

## Verification Commands

Run the normal test suite:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

Expected result at handoff:

```text
Ran 37 tests
OK (skipped=1)
```

Run recipe matching against the sample stock and example recipes:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m foodbrain_assistant.cli --sample --recipes-json examples/recipes.sample.json
```

Export, diagnose, and match Grocy recipes (needs a configured `.env`):

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 scripts/fetch_grocy_recipes.py
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m foodbrain_assistant.cli --diagnose-grocy-recipes-json .foodbrain-local/recipes.json
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m foodbrain_assistant.cli --grocy-recipes
```

Run the sample CLI flow:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m foodbrain_assistant.cli --sample --json
```

Run diagnostics against a local Grocy export:

```bash
mkdir -p .foodbrain-local
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m foodbrain_assistant.cli --diagnose-grocy-stock-json .foodbrain-local/stock.json
```

Run the optional real-data parser contract test:

```bash
FOODBRAIN_GROCY_STOCK_JSON=.foodbrain-local/stock.json PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest tests.test_grocy_real_stock_contract
```

## Next Session Start

1. Pull the latest code on the other PC:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RSM-CEI/foodbrain.git
cd foodbrain
```

If the repo already exists there:

```bash
cd foodbrain
git pull --ff-only
```

2. Create local Grocy configuration from the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` and fill in:

```bash
FOODBRAIN_GROCY_BASE_URL=...
FOODBRAIN_GROCY_API_KEY=...
```

Do not commit `.env`.

3. Check repository state:

```bash
git status --short --branch
```

4. Run the normal tests:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

5. Run the live Grocy flow:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m foodbrain_assistant.cli
```

6. If you save a real Grocy export, run diagnostics:

```bash
mkdir -p .foodbrain-local
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m foodbrain_assistant.cli --diagnose-grocy-stock-json .foodbrain-local/stock.json
```

## Next Implementation Decision

Phase 4 recipe matching is implemented for both local JSON fixtures and live
Grocy recipes, and verified against sample/synthetic data. The deterministic
matcher ranks recipes by pantry coverage plus expiry usefulness, so the "what
should I cook" path works end to end.

The immediate next step is **verifying Grocy recipe matching against real
household data**, the same way stock ingestion was verified:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 scripts/fetch_grocy_recipes.py            # writes .foodbrain-local/recipes.json
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m foodbrain_assistant.cli --diagnose-grocy-recipes-json .foodbrain-local/recipes.json
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m foodbrain_assistant.cli --grocy-recipes
```

Watch the diagnostics for `unresolved_product_count` (recipe ingredients whose
`product_id` is missing from `products`) and `skipped_empty_recipe_count`. If
real recipe names over- or under-match stock, tune the heuristic in
`foodbrain_assistant.matching` (currently word-set containment with light
singularization).

After that, the natural choices are:

- Phase 5 (FlavorGraph pairing) — adds the first external-data dependency.
- Home Assistant MQTT — only if a live dashboard is wanted; the webhook summary
  already carries recipe matches.
- Optional: Mealie or Tandoor as additional recipe sources.

To re-run the live verification on any machine that can reach the Grocy LXC:

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # then fill in the real URL + API key
PYTHONPATH=src python3 scripts/fetch_grocy_stock.py
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m foodbrain_assistant.cli --diagnose-grocy-stock-json .foodbrain-local/stock.json
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m foodbrain_assistant.cli
```

Keep inventory parsing and scoring deterministic. Do not commit `.env`, API keys, or `.foodbrain-local/` contents.
